pygrim2 (2.1.3) testing; urgency=medium

  * COMMIT MESSASGES
  * Makefile - upload to stretch repo
  * pep8
  * json_method decorator now set content-type response header prior to
    calling route handle
  * unnecessary local variable removed
  * Fixed attr names in error_handler decorator
  * Fixed import path
  * regex_route added to example
  * Added @regex_route decorator -- calls re.compile and passes params
    to @route
  * readable_size and readable_si_size filters will now return Undefined
    when no size is given
  * Counter class added to pygrim2.components.jinja_ext.BaseExtension
  * Translations in BaseL10n is implemented as ShortcutsDict, locale map
    is added as shortcuts to translation keys instead of copying
    translations to shortcut keys
  * Fixed bug with i18n extension for jinja -- wrong detection if
    extension is loaded...
  * Improved messge for RouteAlreadyExists exception
  * Improved controller name when logging registered controller (debug
    level)
  * Fixed error with _default_not_found_handler for
    'plain_not_found_suffixes'
  * Instance of l10n is added to view classes upon initialization;
    JinjaView now doesn't create Environment during constructor, but
    saves Env. parameters and creates Env. when render is called --
    environment (with installed translation) is thus request-specific.
    Each that can use l10n should now take care of selecting proper
    translation.
  * Removed unused translations in JinjaView -- translation is inserted
    by the server before render is called
  * Fixed _seo_remove function, percent sign added to seo_removed chars
  * Exception (PatternAlreadyExists) is raised when registering route
    with the same pattern and at least one common HTTP method; regular
    routes are unlike to raise even when matching the same strings
  * Added methods for registering new component types: l10n, config
  * Route names are stored when route is registered -- pyGrim can detect
    name collision, looking for route by its name is much easier
  * Improved print_js function -- now accepts attrs without value (e.g.,
    defer, async) as args
  * Fix for safe_title jinja filter: non-string data are casted to
    string
  * refactor when unknown view is set
  * Revert Code deduplication in components/utils
  * @error_handler can now auto-save when successfully ran -- specified
    with argument
  * refactor of redis connector
  * When error occurs during request handling, request is logged
  * RoutePassed can be used in error handler to move to another error
    handler
  * minor code renice
  * Code deduplication in components/utils
  * Fixed pattern for regular route groups
  * minor refactor in route.py
  * removed 'install_requires' from setup.py

pygrim2 (2.1.2) testing; urgency=medium

  * COMMIT MESSASGES
  * Methods for static files now support uWSGI check-static
  * Added readable_si_size filter for jinja: uses multiples of 1000
    instead of 1024
  * Added @json_method decorator -- pushes data to view and sets view to
    json
  * decorators for components moved to components/utils
  * not_found_hander will use at least empty prefix
  * Fixed bug introduced in ff7ffbbf73c07eb5599b630e45c3dbeaa6f725af
  * micro simplification of add_css and add_js
  * When route was found and exception was raised during template
    rendering, error handlers can still be used to handle error state
  * Excepting without specified exception class replaced with
    BaseException excepting
  * _parse_string sanitizes source input
  * Added docstring for add_cookie method
  * If script_name is not present in environment (or is empty), '/' is
    used
  * Removed soft dependency on non-public compatibility library

    replacement
  * added split_to_length jinja filter
  * NoRoute now evaluates to bool as False
  * Improved readable representation of regular route pattern
  * PyGrim server can now use custom Context class (Context must be a
    parent of new Context class)
  * __getitem__ and _asdict moved from config classes to abstract config
  * refactor
  * missing in 8c1d66fc25ce0c5afac591c4cbc358774702b8b8: server accepts
    JsonConfig as a valid config type
  * Default config removed, replaced with default values being specified
    with config.get()
  * Added support for JSON config
  * Added method for getting single cookie value
  * @route decorator signature simplified: name defaults to
    class_name.handle_name; defaults are set in Route constructor
  * Added DumpView, which is used for data dumping; JsonView now does
    not display assets (js, css); BaseView moved to separate file
  * Lang cookie is properly prolonged; it is also saved when language is
    selected by lang_switch

pygrim2 (2.1.0) testing; urgency=medium

  * COMMIT MESSASGES
  * Fixed Content-Type detecion in http/request
  * fit_image enhanced -- features from pygrim1
  * When using dump view, extra information (data that are added by
    server) use '__' prefix for their keys
  * Changed the way how model is registered: only class is given, server
    will instantiate it itself. Pygrim server will always pass its
    config to model
  * fit_image fixed
  * Fix: Added missing parameter to _default_not_found_handler
  * Session is dumped to JSON only when it was originally loaded
  * Fixed order of assets loaded from config and added through
    context.add_{js,css}
  * url_for removed from jinja filters
  * Code deduplication
  * PygrimYamlLoader inherits from SafeLoader instead of BaseLoader --
    it casts config values
  * Improved methods definition when creating routes; HEAD is supported
    by all routes that support GET
  * Constants for HTTP methods introduced
  * Containers moved from components/grim_dicts.py to
    components/containers/
  * Implemented 'pygrim:route_dump' config option, which will introduce
    debug route for printing registered routes
  * Changed Context constructor, request and response are created by
    server itself, it no longer gives context required classes to
    instantiate
  * Fixed ugly typo in context.__setattr__
  * Methods for printing JS and CSS can now accept extra kwargs, which
    are used as attributes for <script> and <link> tags
  * Added availability to specify file suffixes (via
    pygrim:plain_not_found) that use default not found handler when they
    are not handled by any route (so that missing files are handled as
    '404: Not Found' without consuming time
  * Path info (request uri) is now stored without trailing slash,
    routing is modified to handle this change
  * Static-map is now OrderedDict -- order from config is preserved
  * Jinja extensions: files renamed
  * inverted condition fixed
  * Fixed a bug with file version in view methods
  * pyGrim can now use custom implementation of Request and Response --
    as long as implementation is derived from pygrim's classes
  * Implemented view method for obtaining static file url; refactor of
    related methods
  * Fallbacking Jinja tags for include and extends implemented. They
    take two parameters, templates and prefixes. Both templates and
    prefixes can be either string (only one item given) or sequence
    (tuple, list) when multiple items are used. These tags look for each
    given template through all given prefixes, e.g., when calling '{%
    prefix_include (A, B), (C, D) %}', following temlates are searched:
    C/A, D/A, C/B, D/B. The first found is included / extended.
  * BaseL10N moved to separate file
  * Jinja extensions: URL functions and filters moved to separate file
  * Jinja extensions: minutes_from_seconds filter moved to time
    extension
  * Fixed an error with custom jinja extensions in config -- path was
    unicode instead of str, caused a TypeError
  * Implemented YamlConfig._asdict, used by json2.dumps -- YamlConfig is
    now json2 seraializable
  * Config can now specify its default part, which is merged with loaded
    data; when no default (or None) is given, DEFAULT_CONFIG for pyGrim
    is used -- to use no default config, pass empty dict
  * Server can return its config dir
  * fixed state when duplicate cookie for language received (for example
    Chrome creates such state when the same cookie is set for whole
    domain and for specific path)
  * query_string is now safely obtained
  * Jinja autoreload configuration is loaded as boolean type
  * default session lifetime extended to 7 days
  * fix loading debug configuration variable
  * When dumping data, original Content-Type is dumped, too.
  * Added comment about PygrimYamlLoader -- reimplementation of default
    PyYAML BaseLoader
  * Implemented c_locale decorator for internal usage -- runs method
    using C locale, then switches back to original locale
  * Added safe_title filter for jinja
  * l10n:lang_switch option added -- GET parameter for temporary
    languague switching. Minor refactor of language selection method
    (called by Context.__init__)
  * Accept-Language request header is split into languagues
  * Renamed attribute 'default_locale' of AbstractL10N
  * Fixed fallback view setting (in the case of default error handling) -
    - if view is disabled, it sets dummy view
  * Context loads all required config values in __init__, now it does
    not store config in its attribute
  * Fixed link path in Makefile
  * Fixed package name in debian/control
  * Several minor fixes and refactors

pygrim2 (2.0.0) testing; urgency=medium

  * COMMIT MESSASGES
  * Controllers implemented -- instead of inheriting from server, logic is
    done in controllers that are injected to server instance. There are
    several attributes, that are reserved and cannot be used in controller
    class: _controllers (reference to stack of registered controllers),
    _router, _model.
  * HEAD requests are now implemented not to send any data. However, it will
    still do all operations that would lead to obtaining full set of data that
    would be used for GET request -- thus it will lead to a state that is as
    close as possible
  * Request handling now only needs to set data for view, calling
    view.render() is done by server. RawView class can be used to provide "no
    render". Original server methods display() and redirect() are now removed
    -- server is not accessible in request handling any more.
  * Different handles can use different view instances.
  * Request handles are no longer exposed with @method decorator (or its
    children).
  * Routes are now registered with @route decorator. Its parameters are passed
    to Route. Multiple @route decorators can be used to handle multiple
    different requests with a single handle.
  * Decorators reworked: @error_handler now catches specified exception
    (defaults to BaseException); @not_found_handler is a special case of
    @error_handler that catches pygrim's NotFound; @method and all @*_method
    decorators are removed as it is no longer required to expose handles.
    @template_display renamed to @template.
  * RouteGroups are registered via controllers' (optional) static attribute
    _route_group.
  * Implemented model support -- model can be registered to server instance
    and is passed to Context. There are no requirements or restrictions laid
    upon the structure or interface of model.
  * Session is now loaded when it is accessed for the first time. Passing
    'session=True' to any decorator is now gone.
  * Flash messages interface is moved to context. Flash messages are removed
    when they are read from session. Since session is saved only when no error
    occurs, then old messages are removed and new ones are saved when request
    handling runs without any error.
  * Events from server start are now logged on level 'pygrim_start' instead of
    'pygrim' (which is used for runtime logging).
  * Validators interface implemented -- simple interface to register which
    variables to obtain from method parameters and which validator should be
    called upon them. Validators themselves are not part of PyGrim. Validator
    should implement __call__(value, variable_name, history) to validate a
    value. 'history' is used for nested validators (e.g. dict validator), it
    becames a part of error message when input is invalid and should specify
    which variable is not valid.
  * Proper support for l10n implemented, with tools to simply switch language
  	 and load previously selected language.
  * Exception 'DispatchFinished' renamed to 'StopDispatch'. It is raised by
    context.redirect()
  * Example updated.

pygrim (0.1.19) testing; urgency=medium

  * COMMIT MESSASGES
  * prevent import collision
  * fixed _default_value behavior
  * YamlConfig now prefers BaseLoader to Loader (expands only Python
    types); YamlConfig uses modified BaseLoader so it can handle
    configuration with multiple keys at once -- they turn the value into
    list
  * Logging from YamlConfig now uses uwsgi logger, when available
  * Common config methods moved to AbstractConfig
  * Common functions moved to components/utils; json2 moved there too
  * pridani testu
  * Removed unnecessary set_response_status from example
  * Not-found and error states decorators now set http statuses in their
    pre_call stage: not found uses 404, error_method (used when no
    error_handler handles raised exception) uses 500, error_handler can
    be configured with status kwargs, or defaults to 500 when kwarg is
    not given. Setting http status in decorated method rewrites status
    from decorator
  * Created AbstractConfig, changed some internal behaviour about
    configuration loading; in the future, pyGrim could use another type
    of config format other than yaml
  * cleanup
  * Methods for registering new types for view and session_storage
    components added
  * pid file removed from example
  * Example improved, contains examples for decorators and how to
    properly set response status, body
